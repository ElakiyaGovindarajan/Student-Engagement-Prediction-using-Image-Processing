# Student-Engagement-Prediction-using-Image-Processing
1.Uses image processing and deep learning techniques to analyze student engagement in real time.
2.Captures students facial expressions, eye gaze, posture, and head movement using a webcam.
3.Processes the images using Computer Vision (OpenCV, CNN models) to classify engagement levels as attentive, distracted, or disengaged.
4.Implements deep learning algorithms like CNN, RNN for accurate recognition.
5.Provides real-time feedback to teachers to improve classroom interactions.

Advantages:
->Automated and real-time engagement tracking.
->Reduces manual effort and bias.
->Scalable for online and offline classrooms.
